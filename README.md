# Photo-Album-Viewer
Created a GUI that allowed a user to load in a collection of photographs. Then, the user could recursively 
traverse through this album (forwards and backwards) to view the imported photos. The photos can also automatically 
traverse forwards using a timer. There is also a function that allows the user to print the title of each image into 
a .txt file.
